We create n named pipes for n subscribers since each subscriber would need a different communication channel (a pipe) to get the messages.
Named pipes allow for a dedicated channel of communication between a publisher and every subscriber.
With no individual pipes, messages can get mixed up or lost when multiple subscribers try to read from the same pipe at the same time.
