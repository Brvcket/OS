Explanation of results:
When n = 3, we create 3 child processes. After 5 seconds, they sleep and become zombies. When n = 5, we create 5 child processes, and the similar behavior is happening, but we can see zombies from the previous program call before it's completed, then there is no process from the previous program call. To see this difference I added sleeps between pstree calls.
