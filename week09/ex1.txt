For sample input and number of pages = 1000, number of frames = 200:
random hit ratio = 0.19
nfu hit ratio = 0.22
aging hit ratio = 0.19

Of course, it depents on random seed, on the sample and many other things. But what we see is that generally nfu and aging are a little bit better than random algorithm.
