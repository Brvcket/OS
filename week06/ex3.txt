Let's look at the simulation results for SJF for given sample (open ex2.txt to see the simulation results for FIFO):

process 5:

  tat=1
  rt=0
process 6: 
  at=10
  bt=6

  wt=8
  tat=14
  rt=13
data size = 7
Average results for this run:
  avg_wt=4.857143
  avg_tat=9.142858

As we can see, the average waiting time is significantly lower, because the shorter jobs are prioritized.
Moreover, the average turnaround time is also relatively low. So, in summary, SJF outperformed FIFO in terms of minimizing waiting times and optimizing turnaround times.
